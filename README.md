# TASK MANAGER

## How to use this task manager
<ul>
    <li>Adding tasks</li>
    <li>Removing tasks</li>
    <li>Updating tasks</li>
    <li>Search tasks</li>
    <li>Saving tasks</li>
    <li>More in updates!</li>
</ul>

## Creating tasks

When you create a task, you will be required to input:
<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Date due</li>
    <li>Tags</li>
</ul>
Afterwards, this info will be saved into a save file in the repo 
which will contain all of this info and into a quick database where
you can search and order items (won't be released just yet).

## Finding tasks

You will be able to search for tasks based on their name (a-z, z-a),
their date due (recent, furthest) or their tags.
